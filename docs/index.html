                        <p class="tab">Polyamory is the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships where individuals may have more than one partner, with the knowledge and consent of all partners. We grow up in a culture with many examples of monogamy and monogamous relationships, so having a successful polyamorous relationship can be unintuitive at times. Having peer support and exposure to other models can be invaluable.</p>

                                <q class="tab">There is no substitute for talking face to face with people who have had polyamorous relationships. Being able to meet others and talk about our relationships makes being polyamorous much easier. These relationships can be extremely fulfilling and the amount of joy I get from being polyamorous is hard to match. I had my first poly relationship almost a decade ago. Something just clicked and I realized that loving multiple people really felt right to me.</q>

It means I can be open to all those sparks of connection that make others feel pangs of guilt or regret. It means I can appreciate the joy in my partner's spirit when they connect with someone new, something that monogamous people typically experience as betrayal. It means I get to learn new things with a massive support group of friends who love my lover enough to care for me. </p>

Polyamory creates a space where that can be done safely and with consideration of everyone involved. Being with those who are excited when I say, "Hey I met someone and they are awesome." has been very positive in my life and having those around me that encourage that has helped me grow as a person.</p>

                                                <p>Poly is to me the ability to love multiple people at the same time and have your needs met in a variety of ways. To me poly is very open and freeing and lacks the confinement or resentment that could come with traditional monogamous relationships. </p>
